This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Downloads the dataset in the working directory.

Loads both the training and test datasets.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Creates a second 'tidyDataset' that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidyData.txt.
